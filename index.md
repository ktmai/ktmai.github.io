# Kimberly Tran

I am currently a first year PhD student at University College London. My research involves looking at multimodal learning and semi-supervised methods for remote sensing. More broadly I am interested in:

* Learning with limited labelled data
* AI for social good
* Applying machine learning to the natural sciences
* Widening participation in STEM
