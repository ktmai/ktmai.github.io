# Kimberly Mai

I am currently a first year PhD student at University College London. My research is focused on anomaly detection using self-supervised learning. More broadly I am interested in:

* Learning with limited labelled data
* AI for social good
* Applying machine learning to the sciences
* Widening participation in STEM
