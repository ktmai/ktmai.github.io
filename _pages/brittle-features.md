## Brittle Features May Help Anomaly Detection

We used knowledge distillation to evaluate the suitability of different representations for 
anomaly detection and found that a combination of separability between normal data and anomalies 
as well as more brittle representations (those with higher average gradient norms) tended to be better candidates for one-class anomaly detection.
