## Exploring the applicability of audio deep learning for micro-Doppler classification

Prior to my PhD, I studied for an MSc in Data Science and Machine Learning at UCL. For my MSc thesis I performed an investigation of whether radio micro-Doppler data can be treated similarly to audio data, and hence whether audio machine learning models can be applied to micro-Doppler data to speed up and improve activity recognition. 

This involved transfer learning from [VGGish](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/audioset/vggish) and experimentation with various pre-processing methods to transform radio micro-Doppler data into a representation that better resembled the input data used to train VGGish.
